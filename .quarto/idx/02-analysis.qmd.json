The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown and The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield are tied for second with 165 weeks.

Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens is in second with 54 weeks at No. 1.\n\nIt's interesting that both these books had their fair share of controversy AND a movie adaptation. \n\nI'm using this data for a story chart. [Here](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/G4mb2/) is a link to that chart.\n\n```{r most-weeks-one}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(rank == 1) |> # only include rows where the rank is 1\n  group_by(author, title) |> # group by author and title\n  summarize(appearances = n()) |> # count number of appearances\n  arrange(desc(appearances)) |> # arrange in descending order\n  filter(appearances > 33) |> # only include rows with appearances greater than 33\n  write_csv(\"data-processed/most-one-weeks.csv\") |> # save the data for data wrapepr\n  print() # print it\n```\n\n## How did movie adaptations affect the charts?\n\nLet's see if the books returned to the charts after the move adaptations came out. \n\nFirst, I'll look at The Da Vinci Code. Once I filtered to just look The Da Vinci Code, I noticed that it actually appeared to stay on the charts pretty consistently. I grouped and summarized by year to check what I was seeing. Rather than having a resurgance after the movie came out (in 2006), The Da Vinci code appears to have actually just stayed on the list pretty much the whole time. \n\n```{r da-vinci-code}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(str_detect(title, \"THE DA VINCI CODE\")) |> # only inlcude The Da Vinci Code\n  group_by(year) |> # group by year\n  summarize(appearance = n()) # count the number of appearances in each year\n```\n\nNow, I'll look at Where the Crawdads Sing. The book was published in 2018 and the movie was released in July 2022 (the same week it got on the list in 2022). It looks like the book gained traction in the years following it's release, possibly from the adaptation being announced, but it had slowed down by the time the movie was released. \n\n```{r where-the-crawdads-sing}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(str_detect(title, \"WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING\")) # only include Where the Crawdads Sing\n\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(str_detect(title, \"WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING\")) |> # only include Where the Crawdads Sing\n  group_by(year) |> # group by year\n  summarize(appearances = n()) # count number of appearances per year\n```\n\n## What authors have had the most titles reach No. 1?\n\nI'll find which authors have had the most No. 1 titles.\n\nStephen King is in first with 44 No. 1 titles. John Grisham is in second with 40 titles. Danielle Steel is in third with 36 titles. \n\nThese authors were also top three for most appearances on the chart, just in a different order. \n\n```{r most-one-titles}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(rank == 1) |> # only include rows with a rank of 1\n  distinct(author, title) |> # only include distinct author/title combinations\n  group_by(author) |> # group by author\n  summarize(titles = n()) |> # count number of titles per author\n  arrange(desc(titles)) |> # arrange in descending order by titles\n  filter(titles > 16) # only include rows with titles greater than 16\n```\n\n## What author has had the most No. 1 books in the last 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?\n\nI'll start with 2 years.\n\nJohn Grisham has the most with 5 No. 1 books.\n\n```{r most-one-titles-last-two}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(rank == 1, \n         year >2021) |> # only include rows with a rank of 1 and a year over 2021\n  distinct(author, title) |> # only include unique author/title combinations\n  group_by(author) |> # group by author\n  summarize(titles = n()) |> # count titles per author\n  arrange(desc(titles)) |> # arrange in descending order by titles\n  filter(titles > 1) # only include titles above 1\n```\n\nI'll find which authors have had the most No. 1 books in the last 5 years.\n\nJohn Grisham is in first with 10 No.1 titles in the last 5 years.

Stephen King is in third with 13. \n\n```{r most-one-titles-last-ten}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(rank == 1,\n         year > 2013) |> # only include rows with a rank of 1 and a year over 2013\n  distinct(author, title) |> # only include unique author/title combinations\n  group_by(author) |> # group by author\n  summarize(titles = n()) |> # count titles per author\n  arrange(desc(titles)) |> # arrange in descending order by titles\n  filter(titles > 7) # only include titles above 7\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Goals of the notebook\n\nHere's what I'll find in this notebook\n\n- I'll make a searchable table\n- What authors have had the most appearances on the list?\n- What author has had the most appearances this year? last 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?\n- What authors have had the most No. 1 appearances? \n- What author has had the most No. 1 appearances this year? last 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?\n- What authors have had the most books on the list?\n- What author has had the most books on the the list this year? last 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?\n- What books have been on the list for the most number of weeks?\n- What books were No. 1 for the most number of weeks?\n- How did movie adaptations affect the charts?\n- What authors have had the most No. 1 books? \n- What author has had the most No. 1 books in the last 5 years? 10 years?\n\n## Setup\n\nI'll load the necessary libraries. \n\n```{r setup}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(DT)\n```\n\n## Import\n\nI'll import the data into the notebook by saving the file into a new object\n\n```{r import}\nbestsellers <- read_rds(\"data-processed/bestsellers-full.rds\") # saving the data into a new object\n\nglimpse(bestsellers) # glimpsing the data\n```\n\n## Making a searchable table\n\nI'll make a searchable table to look for certain authors and books.\n\n```{r search-table}\nbestsellers |> \n  datatable()\n```\n\n## What authors have had the most appearances on the list?\n\nI'll use gsa to find what authors have had the most appearances on the list.\n\nRomance author Danielle Steel has had the most appearances on the list with 1022.

The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown and The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield are tied for second with 165 weeks. The Bridges of Madison County by Robert James Waller is in fourth with 164 weeks.\n\nI'm using this data for a story chart. [Here](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/tbXP4/) is a link to that chart.\n\n```{r most-weeks}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  group_by(author, title) |> # group by author and title\n  summarize(appearances = n()) |> # count number of appearances\n  arrange(desc(appearances)) |> # arrange in descending order\n  filter(appearances > 106) |> # only include rows with appearances greater than 106\n  write_csv(\"data-processed/most-weeks.csv\") |> # save the data for data wrapper\n  print() # print it\n```\n\n## What books were No. 1 for the most number of weeks?\n\nI'll find which books were No. 1 for the most number of weeks by filtering first, and then using gsa.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code has the most number of weeks at No. 1 with 59. Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens is in second with 54 weeks at No. 1.\n\nIt's interesting that both these books had their fair share of controversy AND a movie adaptation. \n\nI'm using this data for a story chart. [Here](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/G4mb2/) is a link to that chart.\n\n```{r most-weeks-one}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(rank == 1) |> # only include rows where the rank is 1\n  group_by(author, title) |> # group by author and title\n  summarize(appearances = n()) |> # count number of appearances\n  arrange(desc(appearances)) |> # arrange in descending order\n  filter(appearances > 33) |> # only include rows with appearances greater than 33\n  write_csv(\"data-processed/most-one-weeks.csv\") |> # save the data for data wrapepr\n  print() # print it\n```\n\n## How did movie adaptations affect the charts?\n\nLet's see if the books returned to the charts after the move adaptations came out. \n\nFirst, I'll look at The Da Vinci Code. Once I filtered to just look The Da Vinci Code, I noticed that it actually appeared to stay on the charts pretty consistently. I grouped and summarized by year to check what I was seeing. Rather than having a resurgance after the movie came out (in 2006), The Da Vinci code appears to have actually just stayed on the list pretty much the whole time. \n\n```{r da-vinci-code}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(str_detect(title, \"THE DA VINCI CODE\")) |> # only inlcude The Da Vinci Code\n  group_by(year) |> # group by year\n  summarize(appearance = n()) # count the number of appearances in each year\n```\n\nNow, I'll look at Where the Crawdads Sing. The book was published in 2018 and the movie was released in July 2022 (the same week it got on the list in 2022). It looks like the book gained traction in the years following it's release, possibly from the adaptation being announced, but it had slowed down by the time the movie was released. \n\n```{r where-the-crawdads-sing}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(str_detect(title, \"WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING\")) # only include Where the Crawdads Sing\n\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(str_detect(title, \"WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING\")) |> # only include Where the Crawdads Sing\n  group_by(year) |> # group by year\n  summarize(appearances = n()) # count number of appearances per year\n```\n\n## What authors have had the most titles reach No. 1?\n\nI'll find which authors have had the most No. 1 titles.\n\nStephen King is in first with 44 No. 1 titles. John Grisham is in second with 40 titles. Danielle Steel is in third with 36 titles. \n\nThese authors were also top three for most appearances on the chart, just in a different order. \n\n```{r most-one-titles}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(rank == 1) |> # only include rows with a rank of 1\n  distinct(author, title) |> # only include distinct author/title combinations\n  group_by(author) |> # group by author\n  summarize(titles = n()) |> # count number of titles per author\n  arrange(desc(titles)) |> # arrange in descending order by titles\n  filter(titles > 16) # only include rows with titles greater than 16\n```\n\n## What author has had the most No. 1 books in the last 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?\n\nI'll start with 2 years.\n\nJohn Grisham has the most with 5 No. 1 books.\n\n```{r most-one-titles-last-two}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(rank == 1, \n         year >2021) |> # only include rows with a rank of 1 and a year over 2021\n  distinct(author, title) |> # only include unique author/title combinations\n  group_by(author) |> # group by author\n  summarize(titles = n()) |> # count titles per author\n  arrange(desc(titles)) |> # arrange in descending order by titles\n  filter(titles > 1) # only include titles above 1\n```\n\nI'll find which authors have had the most No. 1 books in the last 5 years.\n\nJohn Grisham is in first with 10 No.1 titles in the last 5 years. David Baldacci is in second with 8.\n\n```{r most-one-titles-last-five}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(rank == 1, \n         year > 2018) |> # only include rows with a rank of 1 and a year over 2018\n  distinct(author, title) |> # only include unique author/title combinations\n  group_by(author) |> # group by author\n  summarize(titles = n()) |> # count titles per author\n  arrange(desc(titles)) |> # arrange in descending order by titles\n  filter(titles > 2) # only include titles above 2\n```\n\nNow, I'll look at the last 10 years.\n\nThe results are fairly similar to the last five years. John Grisham is in first with 16 No. 1 titles in the last 10 years. David Baldacci is in second with 14. Stephen King is in third with 13. \n\n```{r most-one-titles-last-ten}\nbestsellers |> # start with the data\n  filter(rank == 1,\n         year > 2013) |> # only include rows with a rank of 1 and a
