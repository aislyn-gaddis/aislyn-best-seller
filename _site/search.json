I first started this for my Reporting with Data class project in Spring 2023, but I’ve been working on it off and on since to improve and expand it.\nEach tab on the navigation bar is an R Notebook.\nThe GitHub repository for this project is here.\nYou can read the accompanying story here. (Note: I analyzed the Combined Print and E-book Fiction List and did some more analysis on the Hardcover Fiction List after I wrote this story.)"
