title: "New York Times Best Sellers Analysis"
---

I'm Aislyn Gaddis, a senior journalism student at the University of Texas at Austin.

This is just a simple Quarto website for my New York Times Best Sellers List data analysis. I first started this for my Reporting with Data class project in Spring 2023, but I've been working on it off and on since to improve and expand it. 

Each tab on the navigation bar is an R Notebook.

The GitHub repository for this project is [here](https://github.com/aislyn-gaddis/aislyn-best-seller).

You can read the accompanying story [here](https://static.mywebsites360.com/e8130fd5fa4645eaa352da517a890d4e/r/cf8f367cecc54b0e934b010989d989d3/1/Best%20Sellers%20Final.pdf). (Note: I analyzed the Combined Print and E-book Fiction List and did some more analysis on the Hardcover Fiction List after I wrote this story.)
