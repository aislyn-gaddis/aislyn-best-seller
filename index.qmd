title: "New York Times Best Sellers Analysis"
---

I'm Aislyn Gaddis, a senior journalism student at the University of Texas at Austin.

This is just a simple Quarto website for my New York Times Best Sellers List data analysis. I first started this for my Reporting with Data class project in spring 2023, but I've been working on it off-and-on since then to improve and expand it. 

The GitHub repository for this project is [here](https://github.com/aislyn-gaddis/aislyn-best-seller).

You can read the accompanying story [here](https://aislyngaddis.com/what-books-top-the-new-york-times-best-sellers-list-and-why/). (Note: I analyzed the Combined Print and E-book Fiction List and did some more analysis on the Hardcover Fiction List after I wrote this story.)
